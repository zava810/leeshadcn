# On Community Moderation

<AnimatedName />

## 1. Be kind

Always be kind, even when enforcing rules.

This can be difficult. Address issues with empathy and understanding. This compassion can (and should) coexist with firmness. Clearly explain why moderation actions were taken, and if relevant, link back to the code of conduct.

When addressing negative feedback, be exceptionally detailed in your response. Be calm, factual, and empathetic to their concerns.

## 2. Build long-term relationships

Community trust is slowly built over time. There isn't a shortcut or hack.

Give the community more than you take. For example, you should be adding value in 90% of the conversations or interactions you have (e.g., being helpful, answering questions) and only 10% asking for things (e.g., read our new blog post, try the product).

When community members do wonderful things, celebrate them. Highlight their work, give them kudos, maybe even offer some swag.

## 3. Don't stop the conversation too soon

Resist the temptation to overly moderate. Some tension is natural — it encourages open dialogue and different perspectives.

If discussions turn into dogpiling, consider closing them and providing more focused next steps based on the feedback.

## 4. Mostly mute, rarely block

If possible, mute before blocking — this minimizes escalations from upset members after being blocked and creates a less hostile environment. Blocking should be a last resort.

If the conversation turns into harassment or violates the code of conduct, be vigilant and take swift action.

## 5. Take personal conversations private

Always respect community members' anonymity. If you need to discuss private information, move the conversation to DM or email.
